# VGS Allocator

A basic non-thread-safe dynamic memory allocator written in C.


## How to use

Functions work just like stdlib's `malloc`, `free`, `realloc` and `calloc` they just have the namespace `vgs_` prefixed.

Note: The C standard used when developing this was vscode's default `C17` but this should work at the very least from `C89` onwards.
